Todos app based on Angular2 + Redux
===================================

This is the demo app based on [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) tutorial app.

The objective was to migrate client-side to:
- [Angular2](https://angular.io), a development platform for building mobile and desktop applications,
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org), a  predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

Next objective is to migrate server-side to [Vert.x](http://vertx.io), work in progress...

RUNNING THE APP LOCALLY
